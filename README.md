This repo contains the code/simulations used in my thesis.

If you are coming from (the appendix of) my thesis, then the three files most relevant to you are:

- Fairness_Map_under_Distribution_Shifts.pdf --> contains an expression for each possible shift under the SFM for the pop., x-, z-, and (x,z) specific effects.
- Omitted_Results_Equiv_Testing.html --> contains the results for the omitted conditionals from section 4.3
- ConditionalTesting.html --> contains a very in-depth review of different methods to detect distribution shifts from observational data and summarizes the intuition which leads to use of the test described in the thesis
  For that, you probably would want to look at https://akichutkin.github.io/Fairness_under_distribution_shifts/ConditionalTesting directly

The remaining code is hidden away in the other folder to not distract from these 3 files. That folder contains a lot of old simulations but also will contain some new code as I am working a bit on top of the thesis results.
